Common Troubleshooting errors and their root cause while working with UFT:

- Forgetting to load all function libraries before testing a action that needs function libraries.

- If you load a library via code, it wouldnt reflect in UFT. Close open UFT again. 

- Also debug doesnt work when you load libraries via code. As I have been told by a friend, UFT has this bug since version 14 (somewhere early in year 2019).

- If you load a library manually via "add fn library from UFT", you would still need to close and open it again in UFT for it to show
  latest contents. Thre is no auto refresh, or auto save for that matter. Not good, but hey, its called Rusty for a reason! 
  
- Changing parameters in functions call or in functions defination but not setting it in other place.

- If you rename a function and call it in UFT, it will not tell that the function is missing. Instead, it will say
  "Type mismatch: 'GetBrowsersEXENameDummy'". Thats an incorrect message for a missing function. Puts on off in wrong direction and wastes time.Rusty!
  
- While calling a object, call using set. While calling a string function, call without Set. 
	Dim objXML1: Set objXML1 = GetTestEnvConfigurationValue(pathXML, testEnv, Key)
	Dim BrowserName: BrowserName = GetXMLChildNodeValue(objXML1, Key)

- Mixing this up will result in unexpected errors. For example:
	- Not setting a "object" using set command. Example.
		Instead of doing this: Dim envNode: Set envNode = objXML.SelectNodes(xPath)
		Doing this: Dim envNode: envNode = objXML.SelectNodes(xPath)
		
		Another example while returning a function type: Function from test-env-functions (for xml)
		Correct setting: Set GetTestEnvConfigurationValue = envNode.item(0)
		Incorrect setting: GetTestEnvConfigurationValue = envNode.item(0)
		
	- Setting a non-object using set command. Example (for a function that returns string).
		Instead of doing this: Dim BrowserName: BrowserName = GetXMLChildNodeValue(objXML1, Key)
		Doing this: Dim BrowserName: Set BrowserName = GetXMLChildNodeValue(objXML1, Key)
		
		Another example while returning a function type: Function from test-env-functions(for xml)
		Correct setting: GetXMLChildNodeValue = childXMLNode.item(0).nodeTypedValue
		Incorrect setting: Set GetXMLChildNodeValue = childXMLNode.item(0).nodeTypedValue
